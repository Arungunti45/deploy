<h3><center>1.Front-End development:</center></h3><p>
Front-end refers to the part of a website or web application that users interact with directly. It is everything that users see and experience in their browser or on their device.<br>
<b>Key Elements:</b><br>
<b>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</b>

The structure of the web page, including elements like headings, paragraphs, images, links, and forms.<br>
<b>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</b>

The styling of the web page, such as colors, fonts, layout, and positioning.<br>
<b>JavaScript:</b>

Adds interactivity to the page.It enables features like animations, form validation, dynamic content updates, and interactive maps.<br>
<b>Frameworks and Libraries:</b>

Tools that make front-end development more efficient. Examples include:<br>
<b>React, Angular, Vue.js </b>(JavaScript frameworks/libraries for building user interfaces).<br>
<b>Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS </b>(CSS frameworks for faster styling).<br>
<h3><center>2.Data-Base</center></h3>

A database is an organized collection of data that can be easily accessed, managed, and updated. It is used to store information in a structured way so that it can be retrieved and manipulated efficiently.<br>
<b>1. Relational Databases (RDBMS):</b>
These databases store data in a structured format using tables (rows and columns).<br>
<b>Examples:</b><br>
1.MySQL,<br>
2.PostgreSQL.<br>
3.Oracle Database.<br>
4.Microsoft SQL Server.<br>


<b>2.NoSQL Databases:</b>

These are designed for more flexible data structures and often handle unstructured or semi-structured data. They are often used for big data and real-time web apps.<br>
<b>Examples:</b> MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.<br>

<b>3.In-Memory Databases:</b>
These store data directly in the computer's memory rather than on disk, offering faster data retrieval.<br>
<b>Example: </b>Redis, Memcached.
<h3><center>3.Back-End Development:</center></h3>
Back-end refers to the part of a website or web application that handles the server-side logic, data management, and communication with the database. <br>
<b>programming languages:</b>Python,javascript(node.js),java,PHP,ruby.<br>
<b>Key Elements of Back-End Development:</b><br>
<b>Server:</b>

The server is where the back-end code is executed. It processes incoming requests from the client (front-end), interacts with the database, and sends back the necessary response to the client.<br>
<b>Database:</b>

Back-end systems interact with databases to retrieve, store, or modify data. <br>
<b>Application Logic:</b>

 It determines how data is handled and what actions need to be performed based on specific user requests.<br>
<b>APIs (Application Programming Interfaces):</b>

APIs are used to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end or between different services within the system.<br>
<b>Authentication and Authorization:</b>

The back-end is responsible for validating user credentials (e.g., login) and controlling access to different parts of the system (e.g., admin panel vs. user panel).<br>
<b>Middleware:</b>

Middleware are functions that act as intermediaries between the server and the application logic. They often handle things like logging, error handling, or security (such as authentication).
<h3><center>DNS(domain name system)</center></h3>

DNS (Domain Name System) is a system that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 192.168.1.1) that computers use to communicate with each other over the internet.
<h1><center>How Actually 3 Tier Architecture Works</center></h1>

Here we took an example of Register and login forms:-<br>
1.Here basically we have three tiers called frontend , backend,database.<br>
2.In here we used Register and login page to know how the architecture works.<br>
3.We used technologies like Html ,Css&javascript.<br>
4.Html is used for showcasing the content and javascript is used to collect and send the content to the server.<br>
5.Node js is worked as backend logic and mysql is worked as a datastorage.<br>
6.So the Main thing is We have a register page and it is used tu enter the details of a user like Username password and other details.<br>
7.After clicking the register button The data will be sent to the server or backend through APIs .<br>
8.After that The data wil be checked or validated with the select query.<br>
<mark> select *where username="username"</mark><br>
9.After that if the User name is existed it will sends a respone like username is already exists try another one.<br>
10.Else it shows a message like registration successfull and navigates to the login page.<br>
11.After that continuing with the login page in this form it have two insert values like Username and password.<br>
12.if We entered the correct details it will checks or validates the data and shows a message like login succesfull it will navigates to the homepage.<br>
13.Else it will shows the message like password incorrect.<br>
14.Here in Nodejs we have to write logic for Register and login to Take request and Responses.<br>
15.Nodejs takes Response from register button,and mysql validates the data in the database and its response accordingly trough the user interaction.<br>
<h3>Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):</h3>
 SDLC refers to the series of phases or stages that software developers follow to design, develop, test, and maintain software applications<br>
<b>Planning/Requirement Gathering:</b> Definition: The initial phase where the project's scope, objectives, and requirements are defined. During this stage, business needs are assessed, and the software requirements.<br>
<b>System Design:</b> This phase involves creating detailed blueprints for the software.<br>

<b>Development (Implementation):</b> This is the phase where the actual coding or programming takes place. <br>
<b>Testing:</b>In this phase, the developed software is tested to ensure that it functions as expected and meets the original requirements. This includes different levels of testing such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing.<br>
<b>Deployment:</b> After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment, making it available for end-users.<br>
<b>Maintenance:</b> This phase involves ongoing support and improvements for the software after it has been deployed.<br>

<h3>Web Application:</h3>
A web application is software that runs on a web server and is accessed by users through a web browser, typically over the internet. It doesn’t require installation on the user’s device, as it’s run in a browser, and updates are handled centrally on the server.<br>
<b>Examples:</b><br>
1.instagram<br>
2.twiter<br>
3.whatsapp<br>
4.youtube<br>
5.whtasapp<br>
<h3>Standalone Application:</h3>
A standalone application is software that runs directly on a user's local device, such as a personal computer, smartphone, or tablet. It doesn't rely on a server or internet connection to function.<br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
1.Notepad<br>
2.Camera<br>
3.Gallery<br>
4.MSword<br>
5.Calculator<br>
6.Share me<br>
